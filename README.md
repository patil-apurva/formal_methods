## Overview
We developed a motion planning algorithm in continuous-space by combining formal methods and a sampling-based planning method Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) to find infinite paths satisfying Linear Temporal Logic formulae. One of the attractions of the formal methods is its ability to express complex specifications using Boolean, temporal operators, and atomic propositions. Using a PRM-based algorithm we abstract the given continuous-space environment into a finite transition system and use model checkers to generate satisfying trajectories.
